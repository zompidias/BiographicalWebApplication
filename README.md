## Biographical Web Project  

 

This project is for a performing Artist basically her biography  

 
This website was done using ASPNet 2013, Microsoft Sql Server 2012, Bootstrap, MVC, C#.  

I have incuded the sql script to recreate the Database, Tables and stored procedures used.  

To rerun this project one will need to go into the webconfig page  and change the code part below.

> <connectionStrings>  
    <add name="CrystalTetteyEntities" connectionString="server=JOSHUA\SQL2012; Initial Catalog=CrystalTettey; Integrated Security=True; User ID=crystaltettey; Password=crystaltettey" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
    <add name="DBCS" connectionString="server=JOSHUA\SQL2012; Initial Catalog=CrystalTettey; Integrated Security=True; User ID=crystaltettey; Password=crystaltettey" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />  
</connectionStrings>  

The site wont run without accessing sql.  

The screen shots for the site have also been included.  

Pease note the fonts were from Google.   
 

Pics Crys1 t crys5 give an overview of the site Crys6 to Crys8 show the control manager control panel pages. The site owner wanted the ability to add more links to the 'Related links' field and to add more photos into the Photo Gallery This way the owner has the ability to 'Add', 'Delete' and 'Edit' entries n the site.  

 
Crsy1 and Crys2 show the same page There is a drop text animation on Crys2. There is a Photo slide show animation for the pics of Crys2 as well.
